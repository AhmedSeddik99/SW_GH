1-Write program demand from user Enter integer Number and convert it to 
(Binary bit) [program still run don't stop after convert]. 

2- Write a program that prompts the user to enter the number of hours worked 
and the hourly rate. Compute the gross pay, applying a rate of 1.5 times the 
hourly rate for any hours worked above 40. 

3-Write a program to handle operations for addition and multiplication on the 
pair (3 , 5) in three cases: integer, float, and string. Display the result and its type.   

4-Write a program to calculate your grade from the given score. Prompt the user 
to enter his score. 
(100: 85 = A || 85:75 = B || 75: 65 = C || 65: 60 = D || less 60 = F) 

5-Write program to Classify Employee by “nestedif" to  
Manger (GPA > 3.8 && Master && MBA && Experience > +15). 
Staff_senior (GPA > 3.6 && Master && 15 >= Experience > 10).   
Senior (GPA > 3.6 && 10>= Experience >5). 
TeamleaderSenior (GPA > 3.4 &&  10>= Experience > 3 ) . 
Standard ( GPA > 3 &&   Experience > 1 )   
junior ( GPA > 2.5 &&   Experience < 1 )) 

6- Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number greater than 1.5 and 
less than 150. If the number in range, display "Done" and terminate the program 
automatically. If the number is not within the specified range, display an error 
message and prompt the user to enter another number. 

7- "Write a Python program that counts the number of strings where the first and 
last characters are the same display stings matched in another list and number 
them strings . 
Sample List : ['abc', 'xyz', 'aba', '1221'] 

8- Write a Python program to reverse a given list and print the result. 
Sample List : [10 , 20 , 30 , 40 ,50 , 60]

multiply all the numbers in a list. “Ex List: (8, 2, 3, 0, 7) “  

2-Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number and return it. 

3- Write a Python function that accepts a string and counts the number of upper 
and lower case letters. Sample String : “  I'm DIC Engineer at ITI “ 

4-Write a Python program to create a file and write a function template to it. 
Prompt the user to enter the following details: 1. Function Name, 2. Number of 
Arguments, 3. Argument Names.  

5- "Read a file containing these lines, and write to another file only lines with 
'DIC', numbering them as '1-DIC’ 

6- Synthesize a report file search on the words "setup" and "slack" within the file, 
and print the lines containing these words. Additionally, increment the line count 
as you write to the file. 

7-Write a Python program to search for literal strings within Name. 
Sample text : ' Age:25  Name:Mohamed Ahmed  position:Design ' 
Expected output : Name: Mohamed Ahmed.

Python 
Project  
Note: Follow the instructions to reach the best clean code. 
The aim of this project is to create a program that generates template designs and testbench 
Verilog modules. The program will handle the following tasks: 

- Module Design: Generate a file with a name matching the module and write the 
template module design. 

- Testbench: The testbench module should be named by concatenating "_TB" to the 
design module name. This name generation will be automated after the user enters the 
design module name. 

- Testbench Instantiation: Inside the testbench module, instantiate the module designed 
in step 1 and establish connections for all the necessary signals for testing. 

- Clock Generation: The user specifies the clock cycle period, which is then used to write a block 
for clock generation in the testbench. 

- Min Cases: 2 Cases in initial block  in testbensh module.      

-- Additional Notes: 

- Files : Design module and testbensh module ( separated Files )   

- Design: The module should be named such as "Adder" , Testensh "Adder_TB". 

- Signal: For the design module, signals should be named "Datain", while for the 
testbench module, they should be named "Datain_TB". 

- User Input: The program should prompt the user to specify whether the design is 
synchronous or asynchronous. 

- Template Design: The template design should include both combinational and 
sequential blocks. An example of the template design structure is as follows: 

* By implementing this program, you will be able to automatically generate template designs and 
testbench modules, facilitating the development and testing of Verilog modules.
